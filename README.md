# [RedSerenity] Alpine Linux + S6 Overlay
#### Container Image for Alpine Linux + S6 Init System

---

This image serves as the base image for containers that need an init system to launch multiple processes and pass the proper signals when interacting with the container.

Based on [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) with the [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) on it.
